Xolominer Documentation
=======================

This is the xolominer based on the primecoin high performance version of Sunny King's Primecoin tree.

Xolominer features:
- pooled mining client
- getwork-protocol (with longpoll-support)
- code integration into original client

Primecoin tree features:
 * Use GMP for bignum calculations in the mining threads
 * Replaced some bignum calculations with 64-bit arithmetic inside the sieve
 * Reduced the amount of memory allocations
 * L1 and L2 cache optimizations
 * Process only 10% of base primes when weaving the sieve
 * Configurable sieve size
